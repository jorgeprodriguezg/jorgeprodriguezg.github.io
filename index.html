        <p>I am Jorge P. Rodríguez, a physicist studying the complexity of movement and recently focusing on atmospheric sciences. I was born in Albacete (a city located at the Southeast of Spain) in 1990. Since my early childhood, I was curious about the natural phenomena, particularly the wind, as very strong winds are frequent in Albacete. As, when there was wind, classes were cancelled in my school, I built my own anemometer to measure wind speed at home, which I called "controlavientos" (wind-controller). This was my first attempt to measure natural phenomena.</p>
        <p>I studied Physics at Universitat de Valencia between 2008 and 2013, with an Erasmus course at Imperial College London. Afterwards, I studied the Master's Degree in Physics of Complex Systems at University of Balearic Islands (2013-14). Then, I started my PhD (University of Balearic Islands, 2014-2018), defining my research line on the analysis of movement, its causes, properties and consequences. My research applies to multiple process, including the conservation of marine animals, social phenomena, or epidemic spreading. Simultaneously to my Physics career, I studied Social and Cultural Anthropology at the Spanish Distance University (UNED, 2012-2018). Currently, I am studying Mechanical Engineering at UNED.</p>
        <p>As a postdoctoral researcher, I have worked for institutions located in Turin (Italy), Zaragoza, Esporles (Mallorca) and Palma (Mallorca), reinforcing the research area created during my PhD. Additionally, I am lecturer at the centre of UNED in Balearic Islands since 2020, where I teach subjects related to general physics and meteorology.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a staff meteorologist at the Balearic Islands Office of the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). My work consists of developing innovative software to facilitate forecast and climatology, studying meteorological cases of special interest, and being deputy spokesman of AEMET in Balearic Islands.</p>
        <p>I love travelling, especially with my family, and scientific topics or observations always make our trips special. Finding different points of view, measuring or estimating natural phenomena, or just looking for events and places related to scientific knowledge bring us to new places, frequently far from main touristic attractions.</p>
        <p>Apart from trips, I love music and sports, particularly running, with 2 finished marathons, best 21.097 km (half marathon): 1 h 40 min (Albacete, 2016), and best 10 km: 42 min (Minaya, Albacete, 2016).</p>
